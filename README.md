Portal Faction Land is a virtual land plot that you can own in the monoGames metaverse connected with your <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a>. The are 4 different types of portal faction lands you can own which includes:
  <ol>
    <li>Your Personal Land Plots</li>
    <p></p>
    <p>Your Personal Land Plot is free and what everyone starts off with, a one bedroom studio but you can upgrade this building as you grow in the game by completing special missions and buying special nft's. You can buy as many Personal Land Plots as is on the market and rent them out or just add them to your collection. You can decorate your one bedroom studio with nft's, special nft's created by the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-NFT-Creative-Art-Community">monoGames NFT Creative Art Community</a> and with monoGames Partnership nft's. All NFT's that are displayed in your building will have earning capacity and some will unlock new features which will open up more portals to access to even more earning potential.</p>
    <li>Construction Land Plots</li>
    <p></p>
    <p>Construction Land Plots are needed to build Portals and Vehicles to travel throughout the universe. You will need to complete <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Alpha-monoGame-Missions/blob/main/README.md">Building Missions</a> to acquire special nft's to build these items and sometimes you will need to buy and/or trade for special nft's too.</p>
    <li>Mining Land Plots</li>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mining Land Plots gives a player an opportunity to mine 7 resources used for constructing buildings, portals and spaceships, fuel for portals, spaceships and powering up the clocking device. The 7 minerals include; wood, iron ore, copper, oil, silica, diamonds, and precious monoTomic Gold. These resources will need individual land plots which you can portal to from your one bedroom studio once you have complete the required special <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Alpha-monoGame-Missions/blob/main/README.md">Building Missions</a>. Remember some missions will be connected to the Metaverse Mission to complete the task required in the time line wars, Galactic Alliance Wars and other expansion mission.</p>
    <li>Farming Land Plots</li>

There are no limits to how many Portal Faction Lands you can own but there is a limited supply that will given out every year. We hope to evolve Portal Faction Land over time where you live in your community faction suburb setting where you eat, relax and invite players over to your building where you can show them your achievements, your nft's etc so they see your Metaverse. As the game evolves we hope with player suggestions, improved technology and an awesome development team that we can build features that connect our game to the real world so we become a very natural part of life for all our players.
